Design Notes - How to think

Showing data in chunks for GET api
- Pagination
- Static or Synamaic pagination 

Static
GET /events?limit=10
first time offset=0
next time frontend sees how much it has processed and sends
GET /events?limit=10&offset=10

cons - if values added in start it can modify the offset answers

A 0
B 1
C 2

This case shows offset failure case
C 0
A 1
B 2
C 3
